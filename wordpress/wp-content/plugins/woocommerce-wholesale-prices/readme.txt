Have more complex wholesale discount pricing needs for your wholesale customers like WooCommerce category discounts and WooCommerce tiered pricing?

Want to create a WooCommerce private store? Want to show/hide certain products? How about providing an optimized wholesale ordering interface, wholesale registration, user approvals and more? 

You should check out the [Wholesale Suite bundle](https://wholesalesuiteplugin.com/bundle/) which includes all of these features and more.

**SIMPLE & ACCURATE WHOLESALE WOOCOMMERCE PRICING**

No complex setups and no confusing WooCommerce dynamic pricing discount rules to figure out. It's simply plug and play. Providing WooCommerce bulk discounts has never been easier for wholesale WooCommerce customer types.

The plugin adds new new WooCommerce user roles to create a role hierarchy for your customers. This allows you to show WooCommerce multiple prices per product.

After installing the plugin, you'll have a new user role called "Wholesale Customer". This acts exactly like the "Customers" user role that WooCommerce adds.

In your Product Edit screen you'll find a new wholesale pricing box. This lets you enter wholesale prices for the Wholesale Customer user role.

To activate wholesale capabilities for your customers simple change their WooCommerce user account to the new wholesale WooCommerce user role and they will receive the wholesale pricing. It's very simple and the plugin takes care of the rest!

NOTE: If you want multiple WooCommerce user roles you can add an unlimited number of additional roles with the [WooCommerce Wholesale Prices Premium add-on](https://wholesalesuiteplugin.com/woocommerce-wholesale-prices-premium/).

**SIMPLE PRICING WITH FLEXIBILITY (WOOCOMMERCE DYNAMIC PRICING PLUGIN)**

You might not always have a WooCommerce bulk discount for each product so you don't have to set wholesale pricing for all of your products you can do just a sub-set.

Similar extensions like WooCommerce dynamic prices extensions are NOT made for wholesale or B2B purposes. They aren't aware of the challenges of wholesale/b2b sales and they don't take into account the special needs of wholesale customers. This often leaves the store owner frustrated trying to figure out how all those discount rules hang together.

We have purposefully created Wholesale Suite as a flexible solution specifically for wholesale sales. It's the perfect solution to WooCommerce tiered pricing using WordPress's robust user role system.

This free version lets you set prices on Simple products & product variations easily for one wholesale user role and is a great way to get started selling to wholesale customers online.

**GREAT FOR MULTIPLE USER ROLES**

Display of your wholesale prices is automatic once your wholesale customers login to their account. The plugin takes care of the front end display. In this way it's like a WooCommerce private store just for that customer.

Users just need the new "Wholesale Customer" user role and they will see the wholesale pricing that you have set on your products.

You can also add WooCommerce user registration easily with our Lead Capture plugin (more details below).

**COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER PLUGINS**

Wholesale Suite is the most compatible wholesale WooCommerce plugin. Compatible with loads of complementary plugins, such as [Advanced Coupons for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-coupons-for-woocommerce-free/), hundreds of shipping and payment gateways, WooCommerce Currency Switcher by Aelia (even with our free Wholesale Prices plugin!), WPML language switching plugin, WooCommerce Order Form and WooCommerce user registration (Lead Capture) by Wholesale Suite, plus loads more.

**WHOLESALE SUITE ADDITIONAL FEATURES (WOOCOMMERCE ORDER FORM, WOOCOMMERCE USER REGISTRATION, ADVANCED DYNAMIC PRICES & DISCOUNT RULES, PRODUCT VISIBILITY, MULTIPLE USER ROLES, TAX EXEMPTION & MORE)**

Add multiple wholesale roles, multi-levels of pricing, percentage based dynamic pricing, category based dynamic pricing, wholesale minimum order requirements, product min and step requirements, wholesale reports, WooCommerce product visibility control, WooCommerce order form, wholesale lead capture, wholesale WooCommerce user registration form & login form, and much more.
